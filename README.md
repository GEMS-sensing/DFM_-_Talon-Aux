## PCB

- FR4
- 1oz copper
- Lead-Free HASL
- __Blue Soldermask__ 
- __White Silkscreen__ 
- 0.062" thickness

## Notes

- It is acceptable to remove mask stop from any vias which are too close to pads to cause a problem with HASL
- It is acceptable to remove mask from between any SMD pads which are too close together to allow normal mask placement
